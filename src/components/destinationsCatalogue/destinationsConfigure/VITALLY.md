## Vitally

Vitally is a Customer Success Platform for B2B SaaS companies that wraps your unified customer data with powerful analytics, alerts, and automated workflows to help you build successful customers. This means we need to know 1) who your customers are and 2) how they use your product. You can send Vitally that data via our 1-click integrations to popular B2B tools or by integrating directly with us via our Javascript or HTTP APIs.
